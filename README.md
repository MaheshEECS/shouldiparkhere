During T-PREP at UC Berkeley, our team SMASH identified through research that **tourists were most at risk of the car break-in epidemic** in San Francisco because they were not aware of which streets were unsafe.

To alleviate this, we developed and launched shouldiparkhere.netlify.app a website targeted for SF tourists that uses ethically sourced data from San Francisco Police Department's dataset. Using this data, we request all car-related thefts in a 4-block radius of your location (using Google Maps API) in the last 60 days. Based on the number of incidents, we are able to calculate the risk score for parking in that area.

Our risk score goes from **1 to 5**, with 1 being the most safe and 5 being the least safe.

How to use **ShouldIParkHere**
1. Simply enter the address of any location in San Francsico
2. Choose from any of the autofill options in the dropdown menu
3. Wait for the application to calculate a safety score for parking in that area.

A preview of how it works.
